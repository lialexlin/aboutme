I'm Alex Lin, an investment professional and entrepreneur passionate about transforming private markets and building sustainable businesses.

Currently, I serve as an Investment Analyst at **Axiom Asia**, a private equity fund-of-funds where I evaluate investment opportunities and conduct deep due diligence on fund managers across Asia-Pacific markets.

As Founder & Managing Partner of **Edgera Partners**, I'm building a programmatic holdco focused on acquiring and transforming small-to-medium enterprises in Taiwan. My approach combines operational excellence with strategic capital deployment to unlock value in overlooked markets.

I'm also a beginner programmer, constantly learning development and architecture to better understand how technology can solve complex business problems.
